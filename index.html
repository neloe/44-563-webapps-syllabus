        <h2>Expectations</h2>

        This course includes the development of unique, creative applications.
        Students should expect to spend at least 2-3 hours on out-of-class work
        for every one hour of instruction.

        <h2>Email Requirements</h2>

        <p>Professional email practices are required.</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="highlight ">
            Email must include course number and section (e.g.,
            <strong>44-563-01</strong>) in the subject line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Email should be professional, politely written, and use proper
            grammar, capitalization, and spelling.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Course Conduct Guidelines</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Students will behave in a professional manner in all course
            interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Devices including cell phones, ear phones, gadgets, and other items
            should be silent and put away during class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unauthorized use of devices during class may result in reduction in
            scores.
          </li>
          <li>Be ready to work when the class is scheduled to begin.</li>
          <li>
            Be polite and respectful to others in the class. Do not interrupt
            someone during a class discussion, and respect others'
            opinions/comments as you expect them to respect yours.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Citation Requirements</h2>

        <ol>
          <li class="highlight ">
            <strong>Cite ALL Sources</strong>. You must provide proper citation
            for any content including text, images, videos, and code
            <strong>that you did not personally develop</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Do not copy and paste content for any submissions.</li>
          <li>
            Failing to acknowledge assistance including internet photos,
            clipart, slide content, course files, shared solutions, etc. can be
            expected to result in a 0 on the assignment, a one-half letter grade
            reduction, a 0 in the course, and/or a failing the course with an
            academic integrity violation.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Late Work Policy</h2>

        Graded activities are expected to be completed by due date. If you must
        miss class or a due date, contact the instructor in advance or as early
        as possible. Due dates get you ready for coming material. Keeping up is
        critical. On rare occassions, special challenges or obligations may make
        it difficult to submit on time. You typically have a one-week grace
        period where the work may still be submitted and graded. Late penalties
        will be desribed in the rubric. No late submissions will be accepted for
        the final submission.

        <h2>Submissions</h2>

        All submissions must be your own, creative, unique work. You may be
        asked to explain your work during class, in discussions, or in a
        recorded submission.

        <h2>Grading</h2>

        Grades will generally be posted within 2-7 days of the due date. If you
        wish to petition for additional points, please wait 24 hours. Petitions
        must be emailed, and must include the specific changes you are
        requesting, along with your reasoning on why the higher score is
        warranted. Challenges must be raised within seven days of the grade
        being posted; after seven days, grades are considered final.

        <h2>Save Your Content</h2>

        The course site will not be available after the end of the semester.
        Save the syllabus and any materials you wish to access after the course,
        you may need to submit this to a potential employer or another
        university in the future. We do not provide materials after completion
        of the course.

        <!-- Standard University -->

        <h2>Grade of Incomplete (I)</h2>

        Following Northwest Missouri State University policy, incomplete grades
        may only be given in extreme circumstances, such as illness, death in a
        student's immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond a student's
        control, and the student was unable to complete a significant portion of
        the course work.

        <h2>Attendance</h2>

        Students are expected to attend all classes as specified in the course
        syllabi for each course. This course has many in-class activities, most
        of which have points and may not be announced in advance. Students
        arriving late or missing activities due to unexcused absences may not be
        able to make up certain types of work and may earn zero points for the
        activity. Notify your instructor when unable to attend class. Please
        refer to the university policy on attendance at
        <a
          rel="noopener"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf"
        >
          https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf</a
        >.

        <h2>Excused Absences</h2>

        Excused absences include attendance at a university sponsored event
        (documented with an excuse signed by the university sponsor prior to the
        event) or by circumstances considered extenuating by the course
        instructor. A student may make up class work without penalty for excused
        absences.

        <h2>Final Exams</h2>

        If an emergency occurs that prevents the administration of a course
        scheduled final examination, the final course grades will be calculated
        based on the work in the course completed to that point in time and the
        faculty member's considered judgment. Final exams will not be
        rescheduled, and a grade of “I” will not be given as a result of an
        institutional cancellation of a final examination.

        <h2>Administrative Drop</h2>

        An instructor may request the Office of the Registrar delete a student
        from a course roster if the student has not met the prerequisite for the
        course as stated in the catalog, or as a result of non-attendance in the
        course.

        <h2>Course Access</h2>

        Course content is provided via Canvas and Northwest Online. Access to
        Northwest Online is at
